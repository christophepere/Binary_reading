# Binary File in python3 

This script was made at the first step to read and transform binaries files in pandas dataframe structure. 

The library <i>argparse</i> is used to execute the script with input files :
  - "--path_file"         : Path of the located binary file
  - "--file_name"         : Name of the binary file
  - "--header_file_name"  : header name of the binary file
  - "--file_end"          : Name of the file will contain the 10 first lines of the structure in csv
